Subject: [ANN] es-nozzle 0.4.0 - index documents from filesystem

es-nozzle can be used to index documents from the local filesystem or
from network shares. It's similar in purpose to dadoonet's filesystem
river, but it's not an elasticsearch plugin. Instead es-nozzle takes
advantage of RabbitMQ in order to provide a fault tolerant and
scalable system for synchronizing filesystems into an elasticsearch
cluster.

This release brings some improvements and bugfixes. One of the
highlights is support for generating thumbnail previews for images and
PDF documents.

Changes between 0.3.1 and 0.4.0
===============================
- use jcifs from google's enterprise-connector-file-system
- fix completely broken apple garbage filter
- generate thumbnails for images and PDF files and store them in
  elasticsearch
- sanitize extensions
- update documents if their size has changed
- index document size
- make manage worker handle a currently running synchronization
- make manage worker issue one HTTP request every 10 seconds which is
  used for all of the filesystems instead of issuing a HTTP request
  for each filesystem every 10 seconds
- enable the _index field for documents
- esconnect worker doesn't prevent workers being started after
  esconnect itself. in previous versions esconnect had to be the last
  worker being started.

We're excited to get feedback about this release, so please give it a
shot and let us know about your experience.

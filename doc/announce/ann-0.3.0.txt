Subject: [ANN] es-nozzle 0.3.0 - elasticsearch document ingestion

Hi all,

on behalf of brainbot technologies AG I'm releasing es-nozzle 0.3.0 as
open source today. This is the first public release.

es-nozzle is a scalable open source framework for connecting source
content repositories like file systems or mail servers to
ElasticSearch clusters.

The framework supports source-repository security policies in
ElasticsSearch and therefore enables users to create open source
Enterprise Search solutions based on es-nozzle and ElasticSearch.

The architecture allows for scalable and fault tolerant
synchronization setups that complement the scalability of
ElasticSearch clusters.

Professional development and production support is available through
brainbot technologies, a company specialized in search solutions which
created the framework.
